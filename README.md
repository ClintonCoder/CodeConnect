# CodeConnect

CodeConnect is a platform designed to facilitate collaboration and sharing of web development projects. The platform offers a range of features to help web developers connect, collaborate and create projects efficiently.

One of the key features of CodeConnect is the ability to cluster multiple projects together, generating a single integration code for easy implementation. This feature saves developers time by allowing them to easily find and integrate existing projects into their websites, rather than having to create their own code from scratch.

CodeConnect also provides users with the ability to monetise their projects, collaborate with others on a single project, and view analytics such as usage patterns and regions. The platform offers different access levels such as "unlisted" for sharing only with a link, "private" for sharing only with approved websites, "public" for anyone to use for free, and "monetised" for paid access that allows usage on a set number of websites.

CodeConnect provides a range of customisation options for users, such as the ability to add customisable test suites to test their projects on the platform. Additionally, the platform offers a free 10MB storage upon sign-up, with a premium plan available for those requiring more storage.

The platform is suitable for web developers of all levels, and provides a slogan of "Collaborate, Create, Connect" to reflect its core values of teamwork, creativity, and community. With features like clustering, monetisation, and collaboration, CodeConnect is the perfect platform for developers looking to share and collaborate on web development projects.
